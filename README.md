# Unblue

Silverblue without the blue.

# What is this

Unblue aims provide the Fedora Community with a faithful representation of GNOME that stays as close to the original design and vision as possible. It removes tweaks, modifications, overrides and extensions that Fedora adds. Additionally the only provided source for Applications is [Flathub](https://flathub.org/) so you will always get the most up to date applications directly from their developers.

Or Rebase from an existing Silverblue installation!

```
bootc switch ghcr.io/alatiera/unblue:latest
```

# How it works

Unblue is a rebuild of Silverblue, so you will always have the latest and greatest it has to offer. Updates are automated and distributed in the same cadence as Silverblue.

## Future of Unblue

Unblue will be maintained for as long as Silverblue is around, its nature is inherently limited by Fedora itself.

While its built on top of Fedora and Fedora's technologies, it will never have a role in realizing the complete empowerment of developers. It may temporarily show us however how things could be and it can open the door and give us a preview on what a the future could look like, if we are to take the next step. See you one day on [GNOME OS](https://os.gnome.org/) but until then enjoy Flathub and GNOME!
